### Introducing Desirable Difficulties to Enhance Learning and Instruction

## 引入必要难度来加强学习和教学效果

So what are these better conditions of learning that, while apparently creating difficulty, actually lead to more durable and flexible learning? Such _desirable difficulties_ (Bjork, 1994) include varying the conditions of learning, rather than keeping them constant and predictable; interleaving instruction on separate topics, rather than grouping instruction by topic (called blocking); spacing, rather than massing, study sessions on a given topic; and using tests, rather than presentations, as study events.


那么，更理想的学习条件是什么？表面上制造了一些难度，实际上却带来更持久、灵活的学习效果。这种 _**必要难度**_（desirable difficulties） (Bjork, 1994)包括：变换学习环境，而非保持固定和可预测的环境；交叉教授不同主题的课程，而非以主题分组集中教学(called blocking)；对特定的主题，间隔学习，而非集中大量学习；用测验作为学习活动，而非讲授。

Before proceeding further, we need to emphasize the importance of the word desirable. Many difficulties are undesirable during instruction and forever after. Desirable difficulties, versus the array of undesirable difficulties, are desirable because they trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support learning, comprehension, and remembering. If, however, the learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond to them successfully, they become undesirable difficulties.

在进一步讨论之前，我们需要强调 _**必要(desirable)**_ 这个词的重要性。有些不适当的难度在教学中是不可取的。我们所指的 _**必要难度（desirable difficulties）**_ ，体现在能触发学习、理解和记忆的编码及检索过程。然而，如果学习者没有相关背景知识或技能来成功应对，就会成为不必要的困难。

**Varying the Conditions of Practice**

**变换练习的条件**

When instruction occurs under conditions that are constrained and predictable, learning tends to become contextualized. Material is easily retrieved in that context, but the learning does not support later performance if tested at a delay, in a different context, or both. In contrast, varying conditions of practice—even varying the environmental setting in which study sessions take place—can enhance recall on a later test. For example, studying the same material in two different rooms rather than twice in the same room leads to increased recall of that material (Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978)—an empirical result that flies in the face of the common howto-study suggestion to find a quiet, convenient place and do all your studying there.

当教学内容局限并可预测时，学习会倾向语境化。材料在这种情况下很容易通过上下文检索，学习效果大打折扣。在推迟测试时间、改变上下文以及两者结合的测试中，这种学习都无法获得较好的表现。相比之下，不同的练习条件，甚至变换学习场所，可提高在一段时间后的测试中记忆提取的效果。例如，在两个不同的房间中各学习一遍相同的材料，与在同一个房间里学习两次相比，能够加强对该材料的记忆（Smith，Glenberg，＆Bjork，1978）。这些是实证研究的结果已获得广泛认可，而与之相对应，关于如何学习的传统建议是找一个安静、便利的地点，在那里学习所有内容。

A study of children’s learning provides a striking illustration of the benefits of varying conditions of practice. Eight-year-olds and 12-year-olds practiced throwing beanbags at a target on the floor with their vision occluded at the time of each throw. For each age group, half of the children did all their practicing throwing to a target at a fixed distance (for example, 3 feet for the 8-year-olds), while the other half threw to targets that were closer or farther away. After the learning sessions and a delay, all children were tested at the distance used in the fixed-practice condition for their age group (Kerr & Booth, 1978).

对儿童学习的研究提供了明显的例证，说明了变换练习条件的好处。实验让8岁和12岁的孩子们练习朝地面上的目标扔沙包，每次投掷时都会蒙上眼睛。对于每个年龄组，一半的孩子们练习投掷固定距离（例如，8岁的3英尺）的目标，而另一半则投掷到距离可变的更近或更远的目标。在学习完成并推迟一段时间后，让所有孩子都在他们的年龄组的固定目标练习条件下进行测试（Kerr＆Booth，1978）。


Common sense would suggest that the children who practiced at the tested distance would perform better than those who had never practiced at that distance, but the opposite was true for both age groups. The benefits of variation—perhaps learning something about adjusting the parameters of the motor program that corresponded to the throwing motion—outweighed any benefits of being tested at the practiced distance. Many other studies have shown that when testing after training takes place under novel conditions, the benefits of variation during learning are even larger.

根据常识判断，在测试距离上练习过的孩子比那些从未练习过的表现要好一些，但是这两个年龄组的测试结果都正好相反。变换的好处可能是：学习调整投掷运动程序的参数相比在练习过的距离上进行测试更有优势。许多其他研究表明，相比在训练结束后变换测试的条件，在学习过程中的变换练习带来更大益处。



**Spacing Study or Practice Sessions**

**间隔学习还是连续练习**

The effects of distributed practice on learning are complex. Although massing practice (for example, cramming for exams) supports short-term performance, spacing practice (for example, distributing presentations, study attempts, or training trials) supports long-term retention. The benefits of spacing on long-term retention, called the spacing effect, have been demonstrated for all manner of materials and tasks, types of learners (human and animal), and time scales; it is one of the most general and robust effects from across the entire history of experimental research on learning and memory.


分散式练习对学习的影响是复杂的。虽然集中大量练习（例如，考试前零时抱佛脚）能在短期获得效果，但间隔练习（例如分散式讲授，学习尝试或培训试验）会记忆更为持久。间隔对长时记忆的益处，称为间隔效应。通过对各种任务和材料、学习者（人类和动物）的类型和时间尺度的研究，已经证明间隔效应是整个学习与记忆实验研究史上最具普遍、强大的效果之一。

Rather than describing any of the myriad studies that have demonstrated the benefits of spacing, we will simply stress the importance of incorporating spacing and avoiding massing in managing learning. Massing repeatedstudy activities is often not only convenient, but it can also seem logical from the standpoint of organizing one’s learning of different topics, and it frequently results in rapid gains in apparent learning. Good test performance following an all-night cramming session is certainly rewarding, but little of what was recallable on the test will remain recallable over time. In contrast, a study schedule that spaces study sessions on a particular topic can produce both good exam performance and good long-term retention. Furthermore, because new learning depends on prior learning, spacing study sessions optimally can also enhance transfer of knowledge and provide a foundation for subsequent new learning.

无数研究已经证实了间隔学习的益处，不再详述，我们将简单强调在管理学习中加入间隔和回避集中的重要性。大量重复的学习活动往往很方便，从组织学习不同主题的角度来看也是合乎逻辑的，而且经常带来明显学习效果的快速增长。通过临时抱佛脚获得良好的测试成绩无疑是一种奖励，但随着时间的推移只有少量考试中回忆起的内容仍然还记得住。相比之下，通过学习日程表对某个特定主题进行间隔学习，不但能获得优异的考试成绩还能在长时记忆中保存地更持久。此外，由于新的学习取决于先前的学习，优化的间隔学习活动也可以增强知识的转化，并为后续的新学习奠定基础。
