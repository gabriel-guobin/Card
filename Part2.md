### Introducing Desirable Difficulties to Enhance Learning and Instruction

## 引入必要难度来加强学习和教学效果

So what are these better conditions of learning that, while apparently creating difficulty, actually lead to more durable and flexible learning? Such _desirable difficulties_ (Bjork, 1994) include varying the conditions of learning, rather than keeping them constant and predictable; interleaving instruction on separate topics, rather than grouping instruction by topic (called blocking); spacing, rather than massing, study sessions on a given topic; and using tests, rather than presentations, as study events.

那么，什么情况下学习效果会更好呢？看似提高了难度，实际却带来更持久、灵活的学习效果。这种 **必要难度（desirable difficulties）** (Bjork, 1994)包括：变换学习条件，而不是保持固定和可预测的条件；不同主题交叉教学，而不是教完一个主题再教另一个(called blocking)；对特定的主题，间隔学习而非集中大量学习；用测验作为学习活动，而非讲授。

Before proceeding further, we need to emphasize the importance of the word desirable. Many difficulties are undesirable during instruction and forever after. Desirable difficulties, versus the array of undesirable difficulties, are desirable because they trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support learning, comprehension, and remembering. If, however, the learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond to them successfully, they become undesirable difficulties.

在进一步讨论前，我们需要强调 **「必要(desirable)」** 这个词的重要性。很多困难在教学中以及在那之后都是要极力回避的。所谓「必要难度（desirable difficulties）」，与那些不必要的困难相比，在于能够触发学习、理解和记忆过程的关键步骤——编码和检索。然而，如果学习者没有相关背景知识或技能来成功应对，就会成为不必要的困难。

**Varying the Conditions of Practice**

**变换练习的条件**

When instruction occurs under conditions that are constrained and predictable, learning tends to become contextualized. Material is easily retrieved in that context, but the learning does not support later performance if tested at a delay, in a different context, or both. In contrast, varying conditions of practice—even varying the environmental setting in which study sessions take place—can enhance recall on a later test. For example, studying the same material in two different rooms rather than twice in the same room leads to increased recall of that material (Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978)—an empirical result that flies in the face of the common howto-study suggestion to find a quiet, convenient place and do all your studying there.

当教学过程的条件局限并可预测时，学习会倾向情境化。学习材料容易通过当时的情境或上下文重新提取，效果反而会大打折扣。在推迟测试时间、改变情境以及两者结合的测试中，都无法获得较好的表现。相比之下，变换练习的条件，甚至换个环境进行学习，可提高之后的测试中记忆提取的效果。例如，在两个不同的房间中各学习一遍相同的材料，与在同一个房间里学习两遍相比，能够加强对该材料的记忆（ Smith，Glenberg，＆Bjork，1978 ）。这些是实证研究的结果已获得广泛认可，而与之相对应的，关于如何学习的传统建议，仍是找一个安静、便利的地点，在那里学习所有内容。


A study of children’s learning provides a striking illustration of the benefits of varying conditions of practice. Eight-year-olds and 12-year-olds practiced throwing beanbags at a target on the floor with their vision occluded at the time of each throw. For each age group, half of the children did all their practicing throwing to a target at a fixed distance (for example, 3 feet for the 8-year-olds), while the other half threw to targets that were closer or farther away. After the learning sessions and a delay, all children were tested at the distance used in the fixed-practice condition for their age group (Kerr & Booth, 1978).

一项关于儿童学习的研究对变换练习条件带来的优势提供了明显例证。让8岁和12岁的孩子们练习朝地面上的目标扔沙包，每次投掷时都会蒙上眼睛。对于每个年龄组，一半的孩子们练习投掷固定距离（例如，8岁-3英尺）的目标，而另一半则练习投掷到距离可变的目标（更近或更远）。在学习完成并推迟一段时间后，让所有孩子都在他们的年龄组的固定目标练习条件下进行测试（Kerr＆Booth，1978）。


Common sense would suggest that the children who practiced at the tested distance would perform better than those who had never practiced at that distance, but the opposite was true for both age groups. The benefits of variation—perhaps learning something about adjusting the parameters of the motor program that corresponded to the throwing motion—outweighed any benefits of being tested at the practiced distance. Many other studies have shown that when testing after training takes place under novel conditions, the benefits of variation during learning are even larger.

直觉认为，在测试距离上练习过的孩子比那些没有练习过的表现要好一些，但是两个年龄组的测试结果都正好相反。变换的好处可能是：学习调整投掷运动程序的参数，比起在相同距离上的大量练习更有优势。大量其他研究表明，相比在训练结束后变换测试的条件，变换学习过程中条件更有益处。



**Spacing Study or Practice Sessions**

**间隔学习还是集中单元练习**

The effects of distributed practice on learning are complex. Although massing practice (for example, cramming for exams) supports short-term performance, spacing practice (for example, distributing presentations, study attempts, or training trials) supports long-term retention. The benefits of spacing on long-term retention, called the spacing effect, have been demonstrated for all manner of materials and tasks, types of learners (human and animal), and time scales; it is one of the most general and robust effects from across the entire history of experimental research on learning and memory.


分散式练习对学习的影响是多元的。虽然集中大量练习（ 例如，考试前零时抱佛脚 ）能获得短期成效，但间隔练习（ 例如分散式教学，尝试性学习或试训练 ）会维持长时记忆。间隔对长时记忆的益处，称为间隔效应。通过对各种任务和材料、学习者（ 人类和动物 ）的类型和时间尺度的研究，已经证明间隔效应是整个学习与记忆实验研究史上最具普遍、强大的效果之一。

Rather than describing any of the myriad studies that have demonstrated the benefits of spacing, we will simply stress the importance of incorporating spacing and avoiding massing in managing learning. Massing repeatedstudy activities is often not only convenient, but it can also seem logical from the standpoint of organizing one’s learning of different topics, and it frequently results in rapid gains in apparent learning. Good test performance following an all-night cramming session is certainly rewarding, but little of what was recallable on the test will remain recallable over time. In contrast, a study schedule that spaces study sessions on a particular topic can produce both good exam performance and good long-term retention. Furthermore, because new learning depends on prior learning, spacing study sessions optimally can also enhance transfer of knowledge and provide a foundation for subsequent new learning.

无数研究已证实了间隔学习的益处，就不再详述。下面简单强调在学习中加入间隔和回避集中的重要性。大量重复的学习活动不仅易于操作，而且有观点认为这种方法有利于系统地学习不同主题，经常能快速掌握所学的内容，似乎也合乎逻辑。整夜填鸭式恶补后考出的好成绩，当然是有益的。但只有少量考试中回忆过的内容能在记忆中保持一段时间。相对的，按照学习计划对某个特定主题进行间隔学习，既能获得优异的考试成绩还能在长时记忆中保存地更持久。此外，由于新的学习依赖于先前学到的知识，间隔学习有利于加强知识的转化，为后续学习新知识奠定基础。
